Due to the non-linear nature of this program, I've simply written out what each threaded event handler does

1. Initialize window
2. When user selects button, fire given event handler
3. Goto 2 :)

EventHandlers:
List - Displays window with ProgramOfStudy.toString();
Save - Write ProgramOfStudy to pos.dat
Load - Read ProgramOfStudy from pos.dat
Quit - Quit the program
Add - Add a course to the pos
Size - Print the size of the pos
Find - Search for a course
Remove - remove a course by name
Update - update the grade for the course
