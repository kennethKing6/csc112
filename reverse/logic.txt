        1.  Create an ArrayStack of characters called reverseStack.
        2.  Ask for and enter a sentence using a Scanner object called in.
        3.  Create another Scanner object called scan to scan the sentence.
        4.  Use an outside while loop which peels each word from the sentence and continues
            as long as there are words in the sentence.  This while loop encompasses steps 5-7.
        5.  Use an inside for loop to push each character in the peeled word onto the stack.
        6.  Use an inside while loop to pop each character off the stack and display it.
        7.  Make sure to skip a space after each word.
