        4.  Enter the full names (first middle last) of 6 of your friends into nameStack using a loop.
        5.  Display the size of nameStack.
        6.  Check to see if nameStack is empty (it should NOT be empty).
        7.  Display nameStack.
        8.  Peek at the top entry in the stack and display it.
        9.  Pop 3 names off the stack, listing them as they are poped.
        10. Display the size of the stack
